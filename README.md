## 📊 Understanding the Scoring System

### Interview Probability Score
The overall score is calculated using three weighted components:
- **Content Match (50%)**: Semantic similarity between your CV and the job description
- **Skill Coverage (30%)**: Percentage of required skills found in your CV
- **Keyword Density (20%)**: How effectively you've used relevant keywords

### Target Score
1. Set your desired interview probability (default 80%)
2. The system will:
   - Calculate the gap between current and target scores
   - Provide specific suggestions to reach your target
   - Highlight areas needing immediate improvement

### Component Scores
Each component is scored from 0-100%:
- **Content Match**: Uses semantic analysis to measure how well your content aligns
- **Skill Coverage**: Compares required skills with those in your CV
- **Keyword Density**: Analyzes the effective use of relevant keywords
