## üìä Understanding the Scoring System

### Interview Probability Score
The overall score is calculated using three weighted components:
- **Content Match (50%)**: Semantic similarity between your CV and the job description
- **Skill Coverage (30%)**: Percentage of required skills found in your CV
- **Keyword Density (20%)**: How effectively you've used relevant keywords

### Target Score
1. Set your desired interview probability (default 80%)
2. The system will:
   - Calculate the gap between current and target scores
   - Provide specific suggestions to reach your target
   - Highlight areas needing immediate improvement

### Component Scores
Each component is scored from 0-100%:
- **Content Match**: Uses semantic analysis to measure how well your content aligns
- **Skill Coverage**: Compares required skills with those in your CV
- **Keyword Density**: Analyzes the effective use of relevant keywords

## üéØ Using Templates

1. Check `/template/example_template.md` for available variables
2. Use the default template in `/template/cv_template.docx`
3. Or create your own DOCX template using the variables
4. Upload your template in the app's sidebar
5. Your template will be used for all exports (DOCX and PDF)

## üîÑ Recent Updates

- Fixed JSON schema and parsing for CV suggestions
- Improved error handling and logging in LLM client
- Enhanced suggestion display in the UI
- Updated CV schema to better match LLM response format

- Added comprehensive scoring documentation

### LLM Response Format

The system expects LLM responses in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "sections": {
    "summary": "Improved summary content...",
    "education": "Improved education content...",
    "experience": "Improved experience content...",
    "skills": "Improved skills content..."
